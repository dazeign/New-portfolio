                blockchain/Defi-based companies to raise money
                for their projects whilst enforcing transparency. This project targets mostly DAOs (Decentralised
                Autonomous Organisations). QuidRaise gives investors
                a symbol of ownership in the projects by digitizing token shares via NFTs.
                <br> <br>
                Additionally, it enables people to participate in Defi and Blockchain initiatives by allowing them to
                purchase token shares in these businesses in exchange
                for which they receive digital certificates serving as confirmation of their investment.

                principles, wireframes, mockups, and prototypes. To hone
                down on that area of expertise, I ran a single design sprint. I’ll guide you through my sprint process

            <p class="gr-text-9 gr-text-color-opacity">At this point, I already have a concise idea of how to pan out
              the users’ frustrations. The journey is between two different types of customers: the company owners & the
              investors. The users that create companies have to register first,
              after which they can enlist the company details and wait for verification of a period of time that has to
              be stated clearly. While enlisting, data for their token smart contract and token economics information
              has to be collected. The next step is to create rounds where these
              users can set the duration of the rounds and lockup period. They can create any number of rounds. These
              rounds can have tokens that can be acquired by investors and subsequent percentages of the company that
              they cost.<br>
              The second type of customer is the users that can invest. After connecting their wallet using web3
              integration, they can now view the list of all available companies with open shares to be acquired. They
              can now select and purchase the token shares of that company.</p>

                simply brainstormed on the “What ifs…?” that could arise throughout the application
                and I created a user journey for it. <br>
                My first approach to the user journey was to review the goals that are meant to be accomplished,
                otherwise known as the core features. These features are the bedrock of other features and are dependent
                to affect what is needed in the application or not. To this constraint, the important
                features are focused on first and done thoroughly.

            <p class="gr-text-9 gr-text-color-opacity">The first step in analyzing Quidraise’s competitors was to
              identify
              the direct and indirect competition. I analyzed about 4 products that came close to what Quidraise was
              about.
            </p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: number;">
              <li class="gr-text-9 gr-text-color-opacity">GetEquity (<a
                  href="https://getequity.io/">https://getequity.io</a>)
              </li>
              <li class="gr-text-9 gr-text-color-opacity">Binance Launchpad (<a
                  href="https://launchpad.binance.com/en">https://launchpad.binance.com/en</a>)
              </li>
              <li class="gr-text-9 gr-text-color-opacity">Oasis (<a href="https://oasis.app">https://oasis.app</a>)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="gr-text-9 gr-text-color-opacity">Of all the listed products, most of them were indirect
              competitors and this is understandable considering how
              the Web3 space has a lot of open opportunities for ideas. I used these competitors to collect findings on
              how users interact with some UX decisions
              made by the designers of these products. For example,
            </p>
            <p class="gr-text-9 gr-text-color-opacity">GetEquity offered various platforms for companies and investors,
              each with a distinct entry point. A comprehensive
              website outlining the features of each of the two, each of which links to its own dashboard. I was also
              able to obtain certain crucial details from the GetEquity
              onboarding/register process that a conventional company would require to start looking for funding. A
              blockchain startup, on the other hand, required entirely different
              information, which I looked into by doing research and having meetings with the engineering team. Some key
              features or actions I got ideas from GetEquity were How companies
              place tokens for sale, and deal rooms but a simple version named chat rooms, I did not like the user
              experience of the listing of tokens by companies, Quidraise as a blockchain
              application had no need for an in-built wallet since it uses the connect wallet of Web3 applications.
            </p>
            <p class="gr-text-9 gr-text-color-opacity">I adopted the Binance Launchpad method of listing companies since
              I thought it would be more appealing to users.
              I had to stick with something that was roughly related to what the launch pool displayed, which included
              all the pools along with more specific information
              about each of them. I also adopted how company profiles appeared, showing the total amount bet, the cost
              of shares for tokens, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="gr-text-9 gr-text-color-opacity">Oasis had little to no precedent, but because of the clear and
              uncomplicated design of the Web3 interfaces and connections,
              I also borrowed some of their aesthetics, particularly the uncluttered user interface and navigational
              frameworks.
            </p>
            <p class="gr-text-9 gr-text-color-opacity">As a competitor, Apollo made the biggest impression. beginning
              with the signup process, which is primarily useful for
              businesses alone. The information required for company shares, such as the current round, launch date,
              lockup period, and so forth, was pertinent.

              revisions to
              the actions and flows as we went. Additionally, we made an effort to prioritize these aspects more during
              the
              design process by giving them greater weight. Because we used a more qualitative approach, the usability
              testing
              produced a lot of value. I assigned assignments to some of them and instructed them to make an effort to
              complete
              them. I waited and watched for them to accomplish these objectives; when they did, more of my design
              findings were

            <div class="gr-mb-10">
              <p class="gr-text-9 gr-text-color-opacity">Now it is time to create all possible solutions to the features
                that I drafted out for Quidraise. After which I choose the ones to use for the prototype. My goal while
                leading the diverge stage was to explore as many extra possibilities as possible. In this sense, I would
                see other opportunities and insights that could arise from the existing features. Also, if there were
                possible features of lesser relevance, we would remove them and move forward. Also, once we begin
                eliminating as many of these options as possible we are given reason to be more confident in the options
                we do move forward with because we have explored so many alternatives. </p>
              <p class="gr-text-9 gr-text-color-opacity">One of the extra possibilities that we discovered during this
                stage was the level of importance of the NFT certificates. Yes, it would be worth a lot of signs that
                your shares and stake in a particular company are shown in an NFT that cannot be altered but can be
                transferred and show real recognition to the holder.</p>
              <p class="gr-text-9 gr-text-color-opacity">More possibilities are keeping exact records of the decisions
                made on the company using the voting feature… but generally, the anonymity of who has shares in the

                low-fidelity
                sketches were still visible. I began with the low-fidelity sketches, which mostly represented the
                approach
                I would take to the material for the pages. I may use my preliminary sketches as a starting point to

              was

            <p class="gr-text-9 gr-text-color-opacity">The list of corporate pools that investors can stake in is the
              main emphasis of the explore page. The fact that these pools have a defined lifespan determined by the
              companies is what
              inspired my designconcept to separate them into “Active” and “Ended” pools. In that situation, consumers
              can check to see if
              the pool they were watching has closed.
            </p>
            <p class="gr-text-9 gr-text-color-opacity">The pools have cards that may be invested in directly, although
              only a little amount of information appears on the company cards. These cards have the greatest hierarchy
              and most significant
              value, thus the information on them is displayed. The inclusion of a card display for users who might run
              their own
              company was another crucial design decision. They might become frustrated if they couldn’t understand the
              investor dashboard
              if such were the case.

            <h3 class="h3">For Companies</h3>
            <p class="gr-text-9 gr-text-color-opacity">The company dashboard is an incredible tool for companies that
              are already in operation and are searching for finance for Web 3 projects. You must register with the
              information about your business that investors will examine before deciding whether or not to invest in
              it.

            <h5 class="h5">7. Onboarding & Verification Processes</h5>
            <p class="gr-text-9 gr-text-color-opacity">This is a thorough registration process for companies that will
              thereafter be examined and admitted to the platform. When users view a certain company, the information
              that is often displayed on the fields is what they will see on their pages. This authentication process
              ensures that the platform is not being filled with spam companies.

              when rounds are opened to investors, during the lockup period when funds are accepted one at a time, and
              when they are closed for new rounds. The summary of the portfolio apart from the rounds is pretty much the
              same. A smart usage of design patterns for the investors’ dashboards as well as company dashboards.

            <p class="gr-text-9 gr-text-color-opacity">At this time, I had done designing and refining the prototypes. I
              brought the crew together since it was time for everyone to be open and tell the truth like a new time
              user. One of the drawbacks of doing these studies with random people was that we were unable to ascertain
              the users’ past experience with blockchain technology. It is necessary to perform a complete usability
              test on the dashboards.
              The stakeholders and every member of the team treated the prototype as though it were the finished
              product.</p>

            <p class="gr-text-9 gr-text-color-opacity">On a personal level, creating the entire product was really
              motivating, enlightening, and productive for me.</p>
            <p class="gr-text-9 gr-text-color-opacity">However, there were also some areas of concern that were
              identified. Some of the possible struggles that users that found it a bit difficult to fully understand
              blockchain was put to consideration and made the design as easy to use without numerous confusing and
              unfamiliar terms. Additionally, the product’s reliance on cryptocurrency made it easy for most crypto
              users to get started.</p>
            <p class="gr-text-9 gr-text-color-opacity">Overall, I came up with solutions on how investors can easily
              fund projects in a smooth flow. I was also proud of how investors could buy shares in percentages or fixed
              prices and the results of the test of these flows validated my flows. The final tests came out very
              responsive and prototypes were handed over to the developers.</p>
